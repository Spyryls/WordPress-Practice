This is the first WordPress site that I built based off of a Udemy class I purchased 
called, "Become a WordPress Developer: Unlocking Power With Code," taught by Brad Schiff. 
The following is a link to the class I used:

https://www.udemy.com/course/become-a-wordpress-developer-php-javascript/

I would highly recommend to those looking to get a start in front-end development 
with WordPress! I began my journey into coding through LaunchCode in St. Louis. I was 
attempting to build a CRUD based dynamic project complete with authentication using 
Java with Springboot Security and Thymeleaf when one of the mentors suggested I that I 
might have an easier time with WordPress and PHP.

So, thus was born a new venture! I have a couple ideas (my artist website and a mock RPG inn 
for players) I am going to try out once I finish this class so LOOK OUT for things to come!
